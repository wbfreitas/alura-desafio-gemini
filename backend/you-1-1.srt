1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,237
I was born July 1st, 1899.

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,366
I don't remember a whole lot about it

4
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,240
but I guess my parents
were pretty pleased to see me.

5
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,576
They decided
to name me after my father.

6
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,172
So I'm Henry Walton Jones, Jr.

7
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,023
I grew up in Princeton, New Jersey,
at an exciting time,

8
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,719
the very beginning
of the Twentieth Century.

9
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,592
I started to walk at a pretty early age.

10
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,562
Everyone in the house
got pretty excited about it.

11
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,725
- Junior!
- I'm not sure why,

12
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,861
but I've always wanted to see
what was out there over the next hill.

13
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,098
I like exploring.

14
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,333
Look what we have for you.

15
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,172
At an early age,
I met my very best friend in life.

16
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,370
Isn't he cute?

17
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,174
You know how it is
when you really like someone

18
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,078
the first time you ever meet them?

19
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,673
I mean, really like them.

20
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,843
Well, that's how it was
with me and Indiana.

21
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,580
We were buddies straight up.

22
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,316
My dad teaches at Princeton.

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,224
He's a professor of medieval studies
and a very smart man.

24
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,262
He wrote a book about chivalry.

25
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,456
My mother adores him.

26
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:44,731
She's the sweetest, smartest,
most wonderful woman who ever lived.

27
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,070
I'm not crazy about school.

28
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,908
It's not so much
that I don't like the lessons.

29
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,450
I just hate sitting still the whole time.

30
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,949
Yeah. Come.

31
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,387
It's more fun with Indiana,

32
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,288
and I learn a whole lot more,

33
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,724
like how far a ball can travel,

34
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,190
how to beat gravity.

35
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,924
If that balloon hadn't sprung a leak,

36
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,694
Indiana would've been
the first dog on the moon.

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,499
But then I guess he would've been
pretty lonely up there all by himself.

38
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,837
One time, we set out
to break the land speed record.

39
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,773
Round about here,
I learned something really important:

40
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,313
Wherever you are
and whatever you're doing,

41
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,575
always keep
a sharp lookout behind you.

42
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,413
Hey, faster! Faster!

43
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,348
I'll never forget when I discovered
how electricity works.

44
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,448
Indiana was a great help.

45
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,429
One night,
father and mother came into my room,

46
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,264
and what he said changed my life.

47
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,167
Listen carefully, Junior.

48
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,503
Darling, we're going on a journey
around the world.

49
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,966
His new book was such a big success

50
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:02,013
that he'd gotten invitations to speak
at all kinds of schools and universities.

51
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,174
So, Princeton had given him
a leave of absence.

52
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,481
The only sad thing
was saying goodbye to Indiana.

53
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,583
- Bye.
- Goodbye!

54
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,453
Bye! Take care of Indy!

55
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,395
We boarded a giant steamship
that sailed across the Atlantic Ocean.

56
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,028
Our first stop was England
where we visited London

57
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,166
and then went on to Oxford
where my father had gone to university.

58
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,672
He said he had a surprise for me.

59
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,638
Some surprise.

60
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,273
You think your teacher's tough?

61
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:43,287
Let me tell you, she's a pussy cat
compared with Miss Helen Seymour.

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,521
Tutor supreme.

63
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,525
Stand up straight, Henry, dear.

64
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,463
Young man, how old are you?

65
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,425
Nine.

66
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,563
And are you anxious to learn?

67
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,368
Depends.

68
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,774
Depends?

69
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,877
Depends? On what?

70
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,816
On what's being taught.

71
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,121
You may go.

72
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,359
I'm sorry, it's impossible.
He's far too young.

73
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,299
Your son needs a governess.
I'm not a governess, I am a teacher.

74
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,270
You're the best there is.
That's why he needs you.

75
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,898
Dear Professor Jones, he is a child.

76
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,206
I'm used to teaching
young gentlemen twice his age.

77
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,973
It's quite out of the question.

78
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,575
I hate her. She's a witch!

79
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,915
Darling, listen.

80
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,955
Miss Seymour is very highly regarded
in academic circles.

81
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,116
She tutored your father
when he was at Oxford.

82
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,592
He thinks a great deal of her.

83
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,755
Then let him go with her
and we can go back home.

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,296
Which seemed pretty much
like the end of it.

85
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,303
Or so I thought.

86
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,635
And like I said,
my father was a very smart man.

87
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,408
I know how much
you've always wanted to travel.

88
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,003
It's the chance of a lifetime.

89
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,106
Don't say
you're going to turn your back on it.

90
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,275
I'm sorry, Professor Jones,

91
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,445
but I won't go a single mile
with that boy.

92
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,524
Not even to see
the Great Wall of China?

93
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,422
The gardens of Kyoto?

94
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,022
The Taj Mahal by moonlight?

95
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,395
Sunset over the pyramids?

96
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,930
It took nine days
to sail across the Mediterranean Sea.

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,402
I guess my mother and father had
quite a good time on the voyage.

98
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,344
I didn't get to see too much of it, though.

99
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,811
Miss Seymour didn't let up on me
for one bit of a minute.

100
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:58,288
Math, literature, history...
It was like nothing could stop her.

101
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,120
Not even the ocean.

102
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,628
Oh, my goodness.

103
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,141
Heavy weather, Captain.

104
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,513
A bit lively, Bishop.

105
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,019
Hope it's not spoiling
your enjoyment of the voyage.

106
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,783
No, no, not at all.

107
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,825
We British are
a hardy island breed, what.

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,825
Well, young fellow,
how are your studies progressing?

109
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,591
- I learned about mummies, sir.
- Mummies?

110
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,722
Yes, sir.

111
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,995
About how the ancient Egyptians
turned people into mummies

112
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,263
when they died.

113
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,565
Really?

114
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,966
How did they go about that?

115
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:54,103
Well, first, they scooped out the brain.
They took it out through the nose.

116
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,340
Of course, they had to break it first.

117
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,438
Here.

118
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,486
They used a metal hook
and kind of teased it out.

119
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,812
Excuse me.

120
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,155
They took a stone knife,
cut open the left side of the corpse,

121
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,560
reached in
and pulled out all the lower organs.

122
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,098
They put them in four separate jars.

123
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,064
One for the liver, one for the lungs,

124
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,899
one for the stomach
and one for the intestines.

125
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,907
They tied all the toenails
and the fingernails with string...

126
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,371
So they wouldn't fall off.

127
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,642
They plugged up the nose and stuck
little bits of cloth under the eyelids.

128
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,149
And this is really interesting.

129
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,709
Sometimes they used
little onions instead.

130
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,951
That completed the first stage, sir,

131
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,358
the embalming.

132
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,432
Then they had to wrap the whole body
in bandages.

133
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,965
Didn't always work, though.

134
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,967
Most often the mummies leaked.

135
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,630
I believe that I'm wanted on the bridge.

136
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,940
That was an interesting speech, Junior.

137
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,740
Thank you, Father.

138
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,441
Now, eat your tripe.

139
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,089
We landed at Alexandria

140
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,962
and then made our way up the Nile river

141
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,400
to the ancient city of Cairo.

142
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,304
I had never seen anything like it.

143
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,500
Everything was so wonderful,
strange and exotic.

144
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,313
Henry.

145
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,154
As soon as we had settled in,

146
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,525
my father started his lectures
at Cairo University.

147
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,434
Mother was busy helping him out
on the social side

148
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,867
with afternoon teas and things,

149
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,267
so I was left to the tender mercies of

150
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,932
the wicked witch.

151
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,964
From time to time,
I was able to explore things on my own

152
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,125
but, for the most part,

153
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,692
the goddess of knowledge
kept my nose stuck in a book.

154
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,772
- Have you finished?
- Almost.

155
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,968
Good.

156
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,737
Well, when you're done,

157
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,009
we'll take an expedition out
to see the monuments.

158
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,181
- You mean the pyramids?
- Yes.

159
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,253
- And the great, mysterious Sphinx.
- Oh, boy.

160
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:01,257
The Great Egyptian Sphinx
was built around 2500 BC.

161
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,825
Wow!

162
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,162
Now,
why don't we have a real adventure

163
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,729
and climb one of those pyramids?

164
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,769
Why did you only give him 10 piastres?

165
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:24,180
Ten piastres are entirely sufficient
for his services, Mr. Jones.

166
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,911
But he wanted 30.

167
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,011
These people expect to barter.
It is part of their nature.

168
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,649
You'll see. By the time we get down,
he will be perfectly content.

169
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,457
I don't know, Miss Seymour.

170
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,055
He looks pretty mad to me.

171
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,862
Nonsense, Mr. Jones.

172
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,527
Now, when was that pyramid built?

173
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,865
Over 4,000 years old by King Cheops.

174
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,638
It's one of the largest constructions
ever made by man

175
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,475
and one of
the Seven Wonders of the World.

176
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,912
Very good.

177
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,517
Why can't we climb to the top
of the biggest pyramid?

178
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,419
I should be more than happy
to get to the top of this one, Mr. Jones.

179
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,388
Now, let's get on.

180
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,993
Jeez, Miss Seymour,
must have been great to be a pharaoh.

181
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,958
Look, Miss Seymour.

182
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,567
Oh, my goodness!
He's taking our camels!

183
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,264
- Hey, wait!
- Wait! Wait! Come back!

184
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,931
Hey, wait!

185
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,542
- Wait there!
- Wait a minute!

186
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,410
Come back!

187
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,106
Wait!

188
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,814
Come back!

189
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,476
Wait a minute! Come back!

190
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,315
Come back with our camels!

191
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,086
Wait!

192
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,153
Wait a minute!

193
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,497
Guess he wasn't too content after all.

194
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,096
- What on earth shall we do?
- I don't know, Miss Seymour.

195
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,542
- Do we have to walk?
- It's much too far.

196
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,080
Besides, it will be dark soon.

197
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,683
- What if we're attacked by bandits?
- Oh, nonsense.

198
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,845
Or tomb robbers?
They're supposed to be real scary.

199
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,480
Henry, there's absolutely nothing,
nothing to be afraid of.

200
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,684
Look.

201
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,220
Someone's coming.

202
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,766
- Hurrah! We're saved.
- But what if it's a tomb robber?

203
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,878
- Hello, Miss Seymour.
- Mr. Lawrence.

204
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,812
What in heaven's name
are you doing here?

205
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,790
I've been up in Syria
looking at the crusader castles

206
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,226
and I thought I'd take in a bit of Egypt
before going home.

207
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,229
- Hello.
- Hi.

208
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,091
Mr. Henry Jones, Jr.,
of Princeton, New Jersey,

209
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,194
Mr. T.E. Lawrence
of Jesus College, Oxford.

210
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,473
- How do you do, Mr. Lawrence?
- Awfully well, thank you.

211
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,304
And please call me Ned.

212
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,336
I say, you're not related to
Professor Henry Jones by any chance?

213
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,849
- He's my dad.
- I've read his books. They're brilliant.

214
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,643
What happened?

215
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,551
We had a slight altercation
with our guide.

216
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,521
Yeah, he ran off with the camels.

217
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,115
Yes, they do that sometimes.

218
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,456
Yes, but what on earth shall we do?

219
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,690
Well, I'd say
gather up some camel dung

220
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,528
and make jolly sure we don't catch cold.

221
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,545
Time stands still. It has no meaning.

222
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,739
When you open a tomb,
you let in the light,

223
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,184
the first light that place has seen
for three or 4,000 years.

224
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,985
Your feet are the first to tread that floor
since the feet of the men who made it.

225
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,584
You may even see their footsteps
going before you in the dust.

226
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,892
You are breathing the same air
as the men who laid the mummy to rest.

227
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,634
Wow! Sounds great.

228
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,269
I'd like to be an archeologist.

229
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,332
Maybe you'll add a new page to history
or discover a treasure beyond price.

230
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,469
- And get rich.
- No, Henry.

231
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,676
The archeologists don't get rich.

232
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,115
Archeology doesn't steal from the past,
it opens it

233
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,119
so that everyone may learn
from its treasures.

234
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,453
But why did they have all that stuff
in the tomb with them?

235
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,560
They didn't need it. They were dead.

236
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,789
Yes, but they believed that their spirit
continued to live in the tomb

237
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,025
and come alive again.

238
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,363
- Really?
- Really.

239
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,130
Is it true?

240
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,296
No, Henry, it is not true.

241
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,035
But it was what
many of the ancient Egyptians believed.

242
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,307
- Then what does happen when you die?
- You know very well.

243
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,806
You mean, if you're good
your soul goes to heaven,

244
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,351
with all the angels and stuff?

245
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,786
- Precisely.
- But that's the Christian belief.

246
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,983
- Other people have different answers.
- Like what?

247
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,392
Well, a good Muslim will go to Paradise

248
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,895
which, according
to the prophet Mohammed,

249
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,161
is a delightful place,
especially if you're a man.

250
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,100
A Hindu believes in reincarnation.

251
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,899
Reincarnation? What's that?

252
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,098
It means that when the body dies,

253
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,937
the soul reappears in another body
and lives again

254
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,568
and then it moves on again,
and so on and so on.

255
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,738
- The same soul?
- Yes.

256
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,043
- But in different bodies?
- Yes.

257
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,345
Where do we come from?
Where do we go?

258
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,421
It's one of the truly great mysteries

259
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,856
and the spark of most great religions.

260
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,054
So, nearly all of them have an answer
to what happens when we die.

261
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,599
- Which one is true?
- No one's come back to tell us.

262
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,464
Mr. Lawrence.

263
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,635
Oh, but Henry,

264
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,333
if you should meet a mummy one night,
you can always ask him.

265
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,411
Meet a mummy? And ask him?

266
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,205
Yes.

267
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:32,283
When his spirit returns at sunset
and enters his shriveled body,

268
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,148
when he rises slowly
from his dusty coffin

269
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,848
and creeps out into the darkness,

270
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,990
when he glides across the empty desert

271
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,255
where nothing is heard
but the cry of the jackal...

272
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,028
And the shuffle of his bony feet
across the sand.

273
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,602
Shuffle, shuffle. Shuffle, shuffle.

274
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,506
- Wow.
- Mr. Lawrence.

275
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:00,877
Then, if you should chance to meet him,
it may be he will answer your question,

276
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,846
but only if you return with him
to his tomb.

277
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,283
Mr. Lawrence,
it's time we went to sleep.

278
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,649
By the way, I'm going upriver tomorrow
near the Valley of the Kings.

279
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,662
A friend of mine is working on a dig
with Howard Carter.

280
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,958
Would you like to come?

281
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,295
- Can we, Miss Seymour?
- May we.

282
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,862
May we?

283
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,337
Your father will have to
give his permission.

284
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,704
He will. I know he will.

285
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,808
May we, Father?

286
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,614
May we?

287
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,050
Please?

288
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,467
Use it as a journal or diary.

289
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,807
Write down anything
that interests or strikes you.

290
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,608
Thank you, Father.

291
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,349
- And don't neglect your studies, Junior.
- No, sir.

292
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,024
That's wonderful.

293
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,795
He wants to know
what it is you're reading.

294
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:03,300
It's a book about Napoleon.
She says I have to read it.

295
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,603
They're wise people, you see.
They prize knowledge above all things.

296
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,482
Henry, wherever you go,
whatever countries you visit,

297
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,560
learn the language.

298
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,926
It's the key that unlocks everything,
the most important thing of all.

299
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,841
Ned!

300
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,010
Ned!

301
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:34,821
Fancy you, Ned.
How positively delightful to see you.

302
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,053
May I introduce you to
Miss Helen Seymour

303
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,392
and Mr. Henry Jones, Jr.

304
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,897
This is my dear friend, Rasheed Sallam.

305
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,797
Delighted, delighted.
Welcome to you both.

306
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,506
Ned, you're in luck.
We discovered a new tomb.

307
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,735
- A pharaoh?
- No, not a pharaoh, I'm afraid.

308
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,074
Still, everything is important
as Mr. Carter always says.

309
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,513
- Will we get to see inside of it?
- I do hope so, Mr. Jones.

310
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,084
That would be great.

311
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,746
Ghaly, why are those men sitting idle?

312
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,221
- They are afraid.
- Afraid? Afraid of what?

313
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,384
They say there is a curse on the tomb.

314
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,291
A curse? To make people die?

315
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,421
Now, you know
there's no such thing as a curse.

316
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,193
That's what the men are saying.

317
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,268
Get back to work at once.

318
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,365
At once, Mr. Ghaly.

319
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,034
But there could be a curse,
couldn't there?

320
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,665
Well, of course not.

321
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,181
Demetrios is going to blow up the rock.

322
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,655
It'll make a lovely explosion
and clear the road to the camp.

323
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,022
- All clear, Demetrios!
- Okay!

324
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,036
Pierre, make sure
you get some pictures of these seals.

325
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,804
Very good, Mr. Carter.

326
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,403
We found these last month:

327
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:08,452
Pottery, linen and these clay seals,
all 18th dynasty.

328
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,488
This one bears the name
of the king, Tutankhamen.

329
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,749
The boy pharaoh, Mr. Carter.

330
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,389
How old was he?

331
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,028
About your age
when he became a pharaoh.

332
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,156
- Do you think his tomb still exists?
- I'm certain of it, Mr. Lawrence.

333
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,600
And I believe we shall find it
with hard work and a great deal of luck.

334
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,138
I have an almost
superstitious conviction about it.

335
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,606
Not very scientific, I'm afraid.

336
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,310
Henry.

337
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,069
And the tomb you found yesterday,
Mr. Carter?

338
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,775
Also 18th dynasty
but, alas, not the king's.

339
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,183
- His name was Kha.
- Kha.

340
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,950
He seems to have been
some kind of architect or engineer.

341
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,992
We may know more
when we open up his tomb.

342
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,188
- Will you be the first ones inside of it?
- Yes.

343
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,556
Would you like to come along?

344
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,260
Jeepers creepers. Thanks.

345
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,606
The workers won't go in
because of the curse.

346
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,940
Superstition, Mr. Ghaly.
It's only superstition.

347
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,622
Beware, it's the curse.

348
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,219
We must be very careful in here.

349
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,653
Some of these tombs are ain'tight.

350
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,388
When the artifacts that are left behind
begin to decompose,

351
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,590
they create poisonous gases.

352
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:17,176
In the royal tombs there are many traps
to discourage grave robbers.

353
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,880
But since Kha was only an architect,
I doubt that we're in much danger.

354
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,809
"He that enters my tomb
I shall burn with my fire."

355
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,473
It's the curse.

356
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,549
Rasheed, break the seals.

357
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,587
Completely scorched.

358
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,821
Good lord.

359
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,027
- Someone's been here before us.
- Tomb robbers?

360
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,730
- Or the curse.
- Henry.

361
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,199
Well, there's only one way to find out.

362
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,864
My God.

363
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,070
Is that Kha?

364
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,411
That is Kha.

365
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,112
Holy smokes.

366
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,880
Extraordinary.

367
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,544
Why are there no artifacts?

368
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,987
Maybe they were stolen.

369
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,991
I don't think so.
The door seals were intact.

370
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,893
There must be another chamber.

371
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,720
Over here.

372
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,029
Open it up.

373
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,048
Careful. It's a sealed room, remember?

374
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,829
Poison gas. Everybody out! Quick!

375
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,512
All safe.

376
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,047
We'll go back in the morning.
The air will be clear by then.

377
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,124
Put a guard on tonight, Rasheed.
Someone you can trust.

378
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,284
- I'll guard the tomb myself, sir.
- Good.

379
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,920
Better draw a gun from the armory,
just in case.

380
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,624
Can I stay and guard with you tonight?

381
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,834
That's very brave of you, Mr. Jones,
but I'll be all right.

382
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,940
Rasheed, where are you?

383
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,909
Rasheed, where are you?

384
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,706
Come on.

385
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,181
Rasheed!

386
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,623
Rasheed! Rasheed!

387
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,354
Oh, wow!

388
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,524
The mummy's gone.

389
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,895
It climbed out of its coffin
and got Rasheed.

390
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,264
Calm down and don't be silly.

391
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,666
Rasheed.

392
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,205
No, Henry, keep away.

393
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:51,410
- Poor Rasheed. What a dreadful way...
- The fire didn't kill him.

394
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,477
There's a head wound here.
Someone attacked him.

395
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,184
He didn't even have time
to draw his gun.

396
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:04,824
We'll have to take him to Cairo.
There's bound to be an enquiry.

397
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,762
I'll go myself this afternoon.

398
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,825
- Hello.
- What?

399
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,370
Some kind of silver powder.
His leg is covered with it.

400
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,136
No one's been here, nothing is touched.

401
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,548
It doesn't make sense.

402
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,191
- There doesn't seem to be a motive.
- Yes, there is.

403
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,758
"He that enters my tomb
I shall burn with my fire."

404
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,057
Henry.

405
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,193
It's the curse.

406
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:05,955
I mean, there's no motive for his death.
I can't see any reason.

407
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,251
Oh, God, it seems so pointless.

408
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,883
I know it is common,

409
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,828
"All that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity."

410
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,633
But he was my friend.
I shall miss him dreadfully.

411
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,169
You'll see him again, won't you?

412
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,371
- See him again?
- In heaven,

413
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,199
after you die.

414
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,837
If Kha let him go
after he rose from his coffin,

415
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,150
after he killed Rasheed.

416
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,014
Listen, Henry.

417
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,054
When I told you all those things

418
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,597
about mummies coming alive again
and walking the earth,

419
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,130
well...

420
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,467
I'm afraid I must've...

421
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,233
Told lies?

422
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,037
Exaggerated.

423
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,344
And I can't seem to help it.
It's something I do.

424
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,770
Why?

425
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,414
I'm not sure,

426
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,408
but I often tell stories,

427
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,046
you know, make things up

428
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,392
to make life seem more exciting,
more worthwhile.

429
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:38,143
- There's got to be a motive.
- Do we have to do this tonight?

430
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,149
Don't be frightened.

431
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,187
I wanted only to check the room
before anybody else gets in here.

432
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,737
Shouldn't we wait
for Mr. Carter to get back?

433
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,775
No, don't worry,
but don't disturb anything.

434
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:26,230
Well, Henry,
this is what Kha really looked like.

435
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,656
He's beautiful.

436
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,574
"I was beloved of the pharaoh.

437
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:49,117
"As a reward for my great service
he gave me the precious headpiece."

438
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,685
That must be
the one he's wearing, Henry.

439
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,928
"The sacred jackal with the eyes of fire."

440
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,361
Can't be.

441
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,501
- What?
- Can't be the headpiece he's wearing.

442
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,261
There's no jackal with eyes of fire.

443
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,576
You're right.

444
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,807
Wait a minute, though.

445
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,914
Something was here.

446
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,347
It's been broken off. Stolen!

447
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,279
At last, we've got a motive.

448
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,018
That's probably what it looked like.

449
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,923
What did it mean, "eyes of fire"?

450
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,829
The jackal's eyes were precious stones.

451
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,233
That's why it was stolen
and poor Rasheed killed.

452
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,209
But I still don't understand
why the mummy disappeared.

453
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,402
A native wouldn't do it.
It would be sacrilege.

454
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,642
Then who?
One of the assistants? Pierre?

455
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:56,150
Or someone with a foot in both worlds,

456
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:01,290
who knew of the power of the curse
yet didn't himself believe it,

457
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,792
who needed money and hated Rasheed.

458
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,426
Mr. Ghaly, Ned.
Are you going to arrest him?

459
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,024
We haven't got enough proof yet.
We need hard evidence.

460
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,997
I'd forgotten all about it.
What a fool I am.

461
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,538
What is it?

462
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,302
The powder I found on Rasheed's body.

463
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,609
Photographer's flash powder.

464
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,815
Pierre.

465
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,283
I need your help, old lad.
I'm going to search Pierre's tent.

466
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,857
- Pierre will kill you.
- He's not there.

467
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,356
He's over there, see?

468
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,767
Keep your eyes skinned.
If he moves, come quick and tell me.

469
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,466
Holy smokes.

470
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,108
- Play up and play the game, eh?
- Trust me, Ned.

471
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,872
Henry?

472
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,985
- Miss Seymour, have you seen Henry?
- Why, no.

473
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,792
- What's the matter?
- Quick! The tomb!

474
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:22,984
What?

475
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,586
Get away! Help! Help! Get away!

476
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,516
Help! He's going to kill me!

477
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,822
- He's going to kill me...
- That's false!

478
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,726
...just like he killed Rasheed!
- Coming, Henry!

479
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,890
- Help!
- Jesus! He's just crazy!

480
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,025
- I did not kill Rasheed.
- Then what are you doing here?

481
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:11,165
I was taking some photographs
to sell to the newspapers.

482
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,039
Newspapers?

483
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:16,511
There is much money to be made
from such a story.

484
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,950
A man must live.

485
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,012
There was magnesium powder found
on Rasheed's body.

486
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,887
But I'm not the only person in the camp
who uses magnesium powder.

487
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,323
Look.

488
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,890
Demetrios!

489
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,673
Look, magnesium for making flares.

490
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:59,350
He will be at portside by now,
ready to go aboard a ship.

491
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,652
Not if I have anything to do with it.

492
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,790
Where is it?

493
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,653
Hey!

494
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,391
Where is it?

495
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,900
I've hidden it and you'll never find it.

496
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,432
You got him!

497
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:53,140
Yes, but he hasn't got the jackal.

498
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,408
What is Morocco like, Father?

499
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,216
Very old and very mysterious,
not like any place you are used to.

500
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,222
It's a very different culture, son.

501
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,349
- Some of them still own slaves.
- Really?

502
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,428
Hush, dear,
you're getting overtly excited.

503
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,791
- No, but he just said that...
- Quiet, Junior.

504
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,387
It's time we were getting onboard.

505
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,760
- Is it true, Miss Seymour?
- Let's go.

506
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,493
Is it true that some of them
really still own slaves?

507
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,229
- Come on, Henry, let's go.
- Where do they...

508
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,135
- And what exactly do slaves do?
- Let's go.

509
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,147
My notebook.

510
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,475
I've lost my notebook.

511
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,214
My lecture for the Sultan.

512
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,881
Thank you, dear.

513
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,720
If I had really lost it, I'd...

514
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,989
You'd have worried
the whole way to Ouezzane.

515
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:49,532
- How far is Ouezzane from Tangier?
- About 75 miles.

516
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,826
Now, in Tangier, we should be staying
with a friend of mine, Walter Harris.

517
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,565
Walter and I were students together.

518
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,334
Now he's correspondent
for the London Times.

519
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,877
In that case, he sounds
a thoroughly respectable person.

520
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,949
- Walter!
- Henry, my dear fellow.

521
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,857
Good to see you.
May I introduce my wife, Anna.

522
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,221
- Hello.
- Miss Helen Seymour.

523
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,000
- And my son, Henry Junior.
- Delighted to meet you all.

524
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,070
Well, this way.
I have a carriage waiting.

525
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,467
How was the crossing?
Not too rough, I hope.

526
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,564
The Mediterranean can be
awfully unreliable.

527
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,644
I've arranged something tomorrow
which may interest you.

528
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,079
Tea with the Sharifa of Jebel.

529
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:22,750
- The Sharifa of Jebel? Wasn't she...
- Emily Keen. Quite right, Miss Seymour.

530
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,988
Emily Keen is, or I should say was,
an English woman.

531
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,929
- She came over here some years ago.
- And married a native.

532
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,933
Well, he's a bit more than a native.

533
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,230
The Sharif was descended
from Mohammed.

534
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,599
People revered him.

535
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,572
She's a remarkable woman.
I'm sure you'll like her.

536
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,618
Junior! You see what you did?

537
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,420
I'm sorry, Father.

538
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,695
Well, sorry will not make me
presentable for tea.

539
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,443
I can't imagine how Emily Keen could
give up England

540
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,243
for this less civilized country.

541
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:23,886
I think it's very romantic to give up
your country for the man you love.

542
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,374
This is beautiful.

543
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,417
A far cry from London
but it has its charms.

544
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,489
- Mr. Harris.
- Sharifa.

545
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,581
May I introduce to you Professor Jones.

546
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,092
- We are honored to meet you, Sharifa.
- How do you do?

547
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,252
Mrs. Jones.

548
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,159
It is always pleasant
to meet Americans.

549
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,391
Henry Junior.

550
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,967
- Hello.
- Hello.

551
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,699
- Miss Helen Seymour.
- And, of course, a fellow countrywoman.

552
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,569
And you know Sheik Es-Salih,
the Sultan's emissary.

553
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,608
Welcome back to my humble home.

554
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,270
Please, come in. We will have tea.

555
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,807
Lovely.

556
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:33,117
Junior, take the lizard outside.

557
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,358
Yes, Father.

558
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,893
And try and stay out of trouble.

559
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,494
Yes, Father.

560
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,430
The Sharifa introduced
English tea to this country

561
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,264
and I for one am extremely grateful.

562
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,372
Mrs. Jones,
how do you like our country?

563
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,168
It is fascinating.

564
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,675
The religious prejudice
is a little unnerving.

565
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:57,008
I'm afraid we were victims of spitting
from a less open-minded Muslim

566
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,708
than our friend Mr. Es-Salih, here.

567
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,344
There are a few zealots, I am afraid.
I'm very sorry.

568
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,647
If you don't mind my asking, Sharifa,

569
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:11,319
did the people object
when the Sharif married a Christian?

570
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,826
Yeah, they objected.

571
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,956
But, when we married, he told them

572
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,194
that if they ignored me,
they would be ignoring him.

573
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,670
That they could not do
because he was very powerful.

574
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,903
So, the Mohammedans accepted me

575
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,771
partly because of my husband,

576
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:31,007
but partly, I think,
because I did not try to force my views

577
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,014
or religion on them.

578
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,115
As many Europeans try to do.

579
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,514
Perhaps you will allow Omar
to take Henry to the garden.

580
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:40,954
They can play there.

581
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,753
If it would be no trouble.

582
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,118
- Omar.
- As you bid.

583
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,463
Run off some of that mischief, Junior.

584
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,396
- We have a long trip ahead of us.
- Yes, sir.

585
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,572
Okay, catch.

586
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,506
Good one.

587
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,145
What a catch! What a catch! All right.

588
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,017
Mr. Harris and Mr. Es-Salih
have a self-rule.

589
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,421
What are your feelings, Sharifa?

590
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,821
Who better to rule a country
than one of its own people.

591
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,558
My dear Professor Jones,

592
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,032
if you have the ear
of the British or the French,

593
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,932
please tell them that.

594
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,832
I do not have the ear of any government.

595
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,839
I am simply a professor.

596
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,073
Three to zero. You better score or I win.

597
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,578
- Do you wish me to score?
- I want to win.

598
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,581
- As you wish.
- Wait, wait, wait.

599
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,708
I want you to try and score

600
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,615
but you don't have to be all play
and let me win.

601
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,210
As you wish.

602
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,381
One to three. Yeah.

603
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,653
You speak English pretty good.
Where did you learn? School?

604
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,023
I do not go to school.

605
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,461
We speak English to please the Sharifa.

606
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,794
Wait, you don't have to study?

607
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,192
- You're lucky.
- As you say.

608
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,471
Our country is making headway
at its own pace.

609
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,098
You must not judge it
by English standards.

610
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,201
- Are the horses ready?
- Yes.

611
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,939
- Let me guess. For the Sultan?
- A small bribe.

612
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,508
To help ensure that my health programs
may be continued.

613
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,453
- You will present it, please.
- My pleasure.

614
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,018
Well, are we all ready?

615
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,251
We have many miles to go
before nightfall.

616
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,021
All set, I believe.

617
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,588
It was lovely to spend time with you.

618
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,461
We will do it again when you return.

619
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,029
Henry?

620
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,767
- It's time for us to go now.
- Right now?

621
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,776
No complaining, young man.
Put your jacket on.

622
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,507
Will there be anyone in Ouezzane
for me to play with?

623
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,309
I don't know, sweetheart.

624
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,621
I'm afraid we haven't found many
playmates for Henry on our journeys.

625
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:54,748
Oh.

626
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:59,117
Would you like Omar to travel
with you to be young Henry's playmate?

627
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,696
If he would like to?

628
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:01,889
Omar?

629
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,300
You will accompany young Henry
to Ouezzane

630
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,994
and be a good companion to him.

631
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,072
Prepare for your journey.

632
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,938
It's very peaceful outside the town.

633
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,208
Don't get too comfortable.

634
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,543
Bandits roam these parts,

635
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,619
ready to steal anything
from a fine horse to a gold tooth.

636
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,946
You've got to be on your guard.

637
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,121
You know, Omar,
this place looks like Egypt.

638
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,625
- What is Egypt?
- It's a country.

639
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,253
Does not every place look like this?

640
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,490
Nope.

641
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:11,897
Switzerland's got mountains
and Russia's got snow.

642
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,299
I do not know snow.

643
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,894
It's what happens to rain
when it gets really cold.

644
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,975
It kind of falls out of the clouds
in little white flakes.

645
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,135
Does everyone in Russia catch snow?

646
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,643
Well, no.

647
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,980
They kind of let it fall on the ground

648
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,777
so everywhere you look,
you'll see snow.

649
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,545
Every place is different, see?
Here's a map.

650
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,143
- A map?
- Yeah.

651
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,755
It's like a picture of the world.

652
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,360
See? There's Egypt, there's Russia.

653
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:42,489
- I will never see Russia or Egypt.
- You should try.

654
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,564
I had a friend that rode around Egypt
on a bicycle.

655
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,570
I even went on an archeological dig
with him.

656
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,767
I'm going to be an archeologist
when I grow up.

657
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:55,834
- What is "argoist?"
- Archeologist.

658
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,970
It's like someone
who travels around the world

659
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,379
looking for lost civilizations.

660
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,118
So, what are you going to be
when you grow up?

661
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,551
A slave.

662
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,622
No, no, no, I mean when you grow up.

663
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,918
A slave is born into his life.

664
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,087
He cannot leave it.

665
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:27,167
I had no choice
but to give him a double first.

666
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:32,112
Henry, dear, you're so quiet.

667
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,376
You must be very tired.

668
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,385
- No, I was just thinking.
- About what?

669
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,344
About Omar.

670
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:44,189
Indy, don't worry about your friend.
He's well-treated, well-fed and clothed.

671
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:47,422
If he were a peasant
and had to earn his own living,

672
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,761
life would be much harsher.

673
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,232
He is better off as a slave.

674
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,099
I do not believe anyone would trade
freedom of choice

675
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,800
for a roof over their head,
no matter how lovely the roof.

676
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,872
You are in a different culture,
Miss Seymour.

677
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,470
The human spirit
remains the same everywhere.

678
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,949
Slavery was accepted
through most ancient civilizations.

679
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,612
Not having slaves is
a relatively new idea.

680
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,655
What if Omar doesn't
want to be a slave?

681
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,658
Henry, that is what slavery means.

682
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,256
He has no choice.

683
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,058
The Sharifa can sell him
as she could sell

684
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:26,226
a shoe, or a necklace
or anything else that belonged to her.

685
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,203
- That makes him property.
- He can be stolen.

686
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,537
And that brings on what I think
is the true problem with slavery.

687
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,133
- Kidnapping.
- Kidnapping?

688
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:40,182
Bandits kidnap slaves and resell them
in what is a thriving, if illegal, trade.

689
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,417
Yes, nasty business. Nasty business.

690
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,456
Hi. Is there another brush?

691
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,258
Yes.

692
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,765
May I ask you a question?

693
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,900
Jeepers,
you don't need to ask my permission?

694
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,672
Ask anything, anytime.

695
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,714
- This Russia on your map...
- Yes.

696
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,579
How do you get there?

697
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,210
Well, let's see.

698
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:24,349
From here...
Well, let's just check the map. All right.

699
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,489
From here,

700
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:31,431
you could probably take a boat
through the Mediterranean sea

701
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,992
to the Caspian Sea
and all the way up to Russia.

702
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,072
- This is the ocean?
- Yeah.

703
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,472
You know, there's more water
than land in the world.

704
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,478
- Who owns the ocean?
- Why, nobody.

705
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,642
And the ocean
can take you everywhere?

706
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:48,644
Thank you for answer.

707
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,414
Omar, you don't have to
bow around me.

708
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,684
We're friends.
Around me, you're not a slave, okay?

709
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,687
Friends.

710
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,324
Come on.

711
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,380
- Look, there it is.
- Ouezzane.

712
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,139
Allah has delivered us safely.

713
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,117
- My house awaits.
- Why are there big walls around it?

714
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,084
To keep the bad guys out.

715
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,487
- Jeepers, does it work?
- Oh, no, no, no, by no means.

716
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,287
Jones, how would you describe
that smell?

717
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,992
Well, I don't know, really.

718
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,693
I've always thought the city smells
like incense and dead cats.

719
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,497
What do you think?

720
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,674
Well, that's pretty disgusting.

721
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,106
First one there gets a lemonade.

722
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,837
- Go! Go!
- Careful, Junior.

723
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:53,404
- Giddy up!
- Run! Run! Faster! Run! Run!

724
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,083
Ah, lemonade.
Care for a lemonade, Jones?

725
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,419
Indeed.

726
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,922
- Here. Cheers.
- Cheers.

727
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,353
One for the ladies.

728
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,126
Welcome.

729
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,332
This is lovely.

730
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,062
Oh, thank you, dear.

731
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,539
Do you wish to play?

732
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,409
Sure. I'm just going to get
something to eat.

733
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,541
- I will set up goal between two benches.
- Okay.

734
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:40,127
Omar. Quick, go get Haji.
Tell him there's a thief.

735
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,327
Go. Go, go, go.

736
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,765
Go away! Get out of here!

737
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,698
Who are you?

738
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,868
Thank you for trying
to protect my house, Indy.

739
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,506
Mr. Harris!
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.

740
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,379
- You looked like an Arab.
- That's the idea.

741
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,849
Haji, it's all right. It's only me.
There's no intruder.

742
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,683
Just a hungry, thirsty man,
who would like his biscuits and tea.

743
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,986
Omar can help you prepare it.

744
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,055
Why are you dressed like that?

745
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:14,926
It's easier to move around
the marketplace.

746
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,330
An Arab can gather more information
than a European.

747
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,729
Holy smokes, are you a spy?

748
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:25,266
A newspaper man is not really a spy.

749
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,467
No. I went to see a Grand Vizier,
a minister for the Sultan.

750
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,309
Unfortunately,
he had offended the Sultan,

751
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,407
so now his head is on a stick
in the market place.

752
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,509
He was unable to chat.

753
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,020
Jeepers. His head is on a stick?

754
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,648
Yes. You see,
whenever anyone displeases the Sultan,

755
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,750
he cuts their head off, salts it,

756
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,056
and then the head is displayed
to remind everyone else

757
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,256
not to displease the Sultan.

758
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:53,127
So, how exactly
do you displease the Sultan?

759
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:54,760
Oh, many ways.

760
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:58,035
So you mean you could just, like,
say the wrong thing?

761
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,235
It's always advisable to think
before you speak.

762
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,610
Wow. Just the head and no body, huh?

763
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,606
Were its eyes still open?

764
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,583
He stares but sees nothing.

765
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:15,124
Oh, you have a talent for this language.
Good for you.

766
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,893
Say, what is that stuff
on your face anyways?

767
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,190
It's walnut oil.

768
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,755
Don't worry.
It comes off with lemon juice. Here.

769
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,872
Will I join you for tea? Sure.

770
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,508
Shall we call the Sultan
Your Highness or Your Excellency?

771
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,782
I believe Your Highness is acceptable.

772
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,358
Henry. Now, don't go outside
the walls of the house.

773
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,448
It's not safe.

774
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,755
Why, Henry has no time to go exploring.

775
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,262
He has three chapters of Latin to study.

776
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:58,595
- I'll test you when I return.
- Yes, Miss Seymour.

777
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,730
- Mother.
- Yes, dear?

778
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:06,039
Be very, very careful.
You don't want to displease the Sultan.

779
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,470
Mr. Harris says...

780
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,147
The Sultan is very generous
with his foreign visitors.

781
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,682
I'm sure there's no worry
of displeasing him.

782
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,342
Well, enjoy yourself while we're gone.

783
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:17,919
Haji will be here if you need him.

784
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,717
Ladies, the professor is anxious
to give his lecture.

785
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,222
Shall we go?

786
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,993
You and Omar can go out
and play in the garden

787
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,359
- after you finish your studies.
- Okay.

788
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,436
Omar!

789
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,839
Omar, listen.

790
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,809
Mr. Harris says the head of a Grand
Vizier is on a stick in the marketplace.

791
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,411
- Let's go see it!
- American is not safe in marketplace.

792
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,048
I know. I'll dress up like an Arab.

793
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,524
Mr. Harris does it. He showed me.

794
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:01,188
Even as an Arab, not safe.
Many things can happen.

795
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,561
Come on.
I've never seen a salted head before.

796
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,293
I mean, they don't do stuff like that
in New Jersey.

797
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:06,390
Because if I don't see it now,

798
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:07,594
I'm never going to get the chance see it.

799
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,899
Come on, don't argue.
We're just wasting time.

800
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,337
As you bid.

801
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,838
I didn't mean it like an order.
I want you to want to go.

802
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,879
- But I do not want to go.
- Oh, don't say that.

803
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,278
As you bid.

804
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,382
Don't say that anymore.

805
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,582
Come on. Just...
Let's go. It'll be fun, I promise.

806
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,753
Don't worry so much.

807
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,917
Marketplace, it is wise
not to look into the eyes of anyone.

808
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,621
I'm not going to look at anything
except a dead head, all right?

809
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,163
I promise.

810
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,029
I wonder if it's got
maggots crawling out of its eyes

811
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,433
or maybe vultures circling it.

812
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:45,234
Or maybe its tongue's all swelled up
and hanging out of its mouth.

813
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,899
You can't tell me
you don't want to see this.

814
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,537
- I would like to see it.
- I knew it! I knew it.

815
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:52,914
But we must be careful.

816
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,644
If anyone talks to you, answer only...

817
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,786
- Allah is great. Allah is good.
- In Arabic, not English.

818
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,688
It is not here and it is late.

819
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,990
We should be to house
before parents and Mr. Harris return.

820
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,772
- Come on, let's go.
- It is time to go back.

821
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,543
One quick look.
Come on, we're already here.

822
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,083
Omar!

823
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,087
Don't say anything.

824
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,867
Could you untie my legs?

825
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:41,795
Okay.

826
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:50,275
We better forget about the salted head.
Let's just get out of here.

827
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,609
Thanks for coming back for me.

828
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,029
Henry! Henry, we're back!

829
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,766
I'll get him.
He'll want to hear all about the Sultan.

830
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,531
Jones, I think the Sultan bettered
himself listening to your lecture.

831
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,504
- He enjoyed it.
- I think so.

832
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,575
- Fell asleep for a few moments.
- Yes, but only a few.

833
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,837
That makes it a huge success.

834
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:29,182
Fresh lemonade!
Now, that will hit the spot, what.

835
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,920
Henry isn't in his room.

836
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,752
He's probably playing with Omar.

837
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,289
I wouldn't be surprised
if he were hiding.

838
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,120
He knows a Latin exam is
on the agenda.

839
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:40,684
Well, I don't think he'd be hiding.
He'd want to hear about the Sultan.

840
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,991
Haji, go and check
the house and grounds.

841
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:50,532
Henry!

842
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,506
- What is it, Harris?
- Henry!

843
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,544
Damn.

844
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,239
What?

845
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:04,843
Mr. Harris! Mr. Harris! Mr. Harris.

846
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,390
The boy is not in house.
They must sneak out.

847
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,856
Bring my hat and cane.
I think I know where they've gone.

848
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,949
Where?

849
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,291
I'm afraid I made something
I saw in the marketplace this morning

850
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,958
a little too compelling to ignore,
and he was fascinated.

851
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:21,264
Are you saying
they went alone to the marketplace?

852
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,065
- My hat. I'm going with you.
- No, I'd better go alone.

853
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,473
He's my son. I'm going with you.

854
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:49,056
I know the people. I'll ask.

855
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,043
Junior!

856
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,373
Has he seen him?

857
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,170
- What was he saying?
- We can waste no time.

858
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,971
Damn it, man! Tell me what he said.

859
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,805
Don't tell me I'm not coming, Harris.
I am going with you.

860
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,214
You don't speak the language,
you don't know the land.

861
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,787
You'd slow me down.
Every minute counts.

862
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,378
Trust me, it's better that you stay here.

863
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,355
Then I'll go to the Sultan,
ask him for help.

864
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,517
No, don't alert the Sultan.

865
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,492
Henry, word travels fast.

866
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,757
If the kidnappers got wind of it,
the boys could be in trouble.

867
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,026
They'd sooner destroy the evidence
than get caught.

868
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,001
Oh, my God!
Are you saying that they might...

869
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,695
Mrs. Jones...

870
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,440
I showed Indy how to use the make-up.

871
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,637
I put the idea in his head.

872
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:14,614
I will never forgive myself
if I do not return your son to you.

873
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,410
Please, bring him back.

874
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:28,890
Haji!

875
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:49,884
- This is all my fault. I got us into this.
- Be quiet! Don't let them hear you.

876
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:51,782
Maybe if I tell them I'm American,
they'll let us go.

877
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,720
They would rather kill you
so that you will not cause them trouble.

878
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,188
Kill me? That's not good.

879
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,226
We must hope
a good and kind master buys us.

880
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,922
I can't be a slave.
I'm supposed to be studying Latin.

881
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,764
A slave does not need to know Latin.

882
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,530
- Maybe someone will rescue us.
- No one knows where we are.

883
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,302
We'll have to escape.

884
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:56,547
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

885
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,181
Now.

886
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,779
We're being rescued.

887
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,821
- Why does he care about my teeth?
- Because we have been stolen.

888
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,828
- What are they going to do with us?
- Sell us.

889
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:53,031
- So, we're... We're not rescued?
- We are still slaves to be sold.

890
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,829
We should pray now for a kind master.

891
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,403
I'm not gonna to get to see
my mother and father again, will I?

892
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,544
Omar, tell me the truth.

893
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:23,676
I was sold into slavery when I was born.
I never knew my mother or my father.

894
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,054
I never got to say goodbye.

895
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:49,017
Have you any idea how worried
and heartsick your parents really are?

896
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,648
Mr. Harris.

897
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,021
Are you here to take me to my parents?

898
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,116
First, I want you to promise me

899
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,889
you will never do anything
as foolish as this again!

900
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:56,520
I promise.

901
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,327
- It's real good to see you.
- I don't doubt that.

902
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,834
That's a wonderful disguise.
Look at you.

903
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,666
You know,
you really have got a flare for this.

904
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:04,830
How did you know where to find me?

905
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,807
This is the only place left in the country
where slaves can still be sold.

906
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,843
Come on. We mustn't keep your parents
waiting any longer.

907
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:11,242
What about Omar?

908
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,075
No, no, it's too risky.
We're both in disguise.

909
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,479
- We have to get out of here.
- No.

910
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,878
He could have left me in Ouezzane.

911
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,180
He came back for me.

912
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,346
Indy, Omar is a slave.

913
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,117
Wherever he is a slave
will make no difference.

914
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,023
He's my friend. I won't leave him.

915
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,953
I paid 400 rial for you.
I only have 100 left.

916
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:32,090
- That's not enough to buy Omar!
- We have to try.

917
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:35,630
Please.

918
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,910
Omar, it's Mr. Harris. We're free.

919
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,447
Is that true? Mr. Harris?

920
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,642
You're going back to the Sharifa.
That's where you belong.

921
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,276
Yes, Mr. Harris.
I am forever in your debt.

922
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,581
That's quite all right.

923
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,913
Hang on, Indy! Run, Omar, run!

924
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:21,901
- Well done, Harris.
- Think nothing of it, dear boy.

925
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:23,265
Thank you.

926
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:29,699
Oh, dear!

927
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,239
Welcome back.

928
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:36,476
Was the Sultan pleased
with your lecture, Professor Jones?

929
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,917
- Absolutely thrilled.
- Thank you for asking.

930
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,182
And did you all have a good journey?

931
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,283
It was a journey which proved
to be educational for everyone.

932
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:50,330
And Omar, did you serve
as a good companion to young Henry?

933
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:53,367
Yes. Yes, he did. Didn't he, Father?

934
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,402
Wasn't Omar
just the best companion I've ever had?

935
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,368
He did everything I asked him to.

936
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:01,465
- Isn't that right, Father?
- Yes. Yes, that's true.

937
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,942
Omar followed Junior's every whim.

938
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:06,410
Very good.

939
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,446
Omar, go inside
and help with the cleaning.

940
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,308
Yes, Mistress.

941
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,055
Omar, wait.

942
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:21,354
Let me show you all the flowers
that have bloomed since your last visit.

943
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:22,986
So...

944
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:26,758
Maybe there'll be
another salted head some day.

945
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:33,070
I hope you get to be an archeologist.

946
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,601
I hope you get...

947
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:39,072
Well, I hope I see you again.

948
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:41,407
Yes.

949
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:47,611
Maybe I could show you the mountains
of Switzerland and New Jersey.

950
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,486
Or the ocean.

951
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,858
Yeah, the ocean. That'd be good.

952
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:59,033
Indy, you have given me
dreams to dream.

953
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:04,404
It is not my place to see or to go,
like you.

954
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:06,974
But now, at least I have dreams.

955
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:11,971
Yeah.

956
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:15,708
- Take this.
- It is your map.

957
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:17,575
No, I'll just...

958
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:21,044
- I'll make another one.
- Thank you.

959
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:25,485
I must go back to my duties.

960
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,586
- Indy...
- No. No, Omar.

961
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,099
Friends shake hands.
